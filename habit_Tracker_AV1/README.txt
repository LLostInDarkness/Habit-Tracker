Hello! If you're reading this then that means you are wanting to run my 
2024 CS-11 final project aka my terminal based habit tracker.

For this version, it only tracks your water intake for the day.
Each time you reload the application, it will reset and prompt you the
same questions as the first time playing.  So for best results, it's
recommended to have this running in the background until you completed
your habit goal.

Here's how you can run the habit tracker:
1. Download all files and DO NOT edit them.
2. Complie the main.cpp and habit_tracker.cpp file (using g++, gcc)
   using a C++ compliler do not compile the .h file with the .cpp file.  
   Follow this: g++ main.cpp habit_tracker.cpp
3. Then do ./a.out and follow the directions in the terminal.

In future versions, there will be: 
    1. More options to choose from (i.e. amount of time and days 
       you've worked out in a specified amount of time)
    2. A better save so you'll be able to earn more than one habit 
       point each time you compile/load the application.
   3. A way to use your habit points you've accumulated over the 
      course of time.
   4. Graphics/UX design.

Note: If you do input a string for the prompt on how much water you 
      recently drank, it will think you input 0 instead of a string.
      This is will be fixed in later versions.
